- adjust colour scheme - orange/red is only for very important buttons - core functionality (must be the minority)
- speed up loading (API routes seem to be quite slow right now)
- ensure translation system is comprehensive (everything gets translated) - NOT UNTIL COPY FINALISED
- add avatars (need to add images to public folder before this is possible)
- create feature which converts data into prompt for making PPTs for parents evenings/open classes - takes data as input and outputs markdown prompt for AI presentation generator - make teachers lives as easy as possible - designed with AI-use in mind :) 
- create admin dashboard for admin user so they can see this data for all users (all teachers using the software) (PHASE 2 DEVELOPMENT IDEA - NOT YET)
- add a set up stage so teachers can choose which exams their students do and if they have portfolios etc (tailored to each teacher's use case) (NOT YET)
